A previsualization component for setting up projectors in TouchDesigner

The Position parameter is broken pending a Derivative Fix in builds 25400+. For now you need to use the transform parameter and unreference. Also dragging Previz.tox into touch is broken due to another TouchDesigner bug. For now you need to open and then copy paste into your network. This will be fixed in builds 25160+
